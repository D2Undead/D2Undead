I’m interested in these languages:
   JavaScript
   HTML / CSS
   Python
I'm also interested in most coding projects; especially HTML games, 3D renderers, pixel art, sandbox games, and physics simulators.
I’m always learning client-side JavaScript by making HTML pages. I already have done quite a few tutorials. I also want to know how to create executable JavaScript files.

I like physics and maths and I love random facts.
Be aware that I can be a bit extensive when asked about something.
