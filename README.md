- 👋 Hi, I’m @J5Now
- 👀 I’m interested in these languages:
   - JavaScript
   - HTML / CSS
   - Java (although I am not a very decent Java coder)
   - C++
   - Python
   - C# (all I do with C# code is stare at it until I can understand two lines)
- 👀 I'm also interested in most coding projects; especially HTML games, 3D renderers, pixel art, sandbox games, and physics simulators.
- 🌱 I’m always learning client-side JavaScript by making HTML pages. I already have done quite a few tutorials. I also want to know how to create executable JavaScript files.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Nothing yet. Maybe in a few years I will look at something.
- 📫 How to reach me: If you want to say something to me, then see me on Reddit (u/D2Undead).
